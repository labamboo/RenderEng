# RenderEng
Building a rendering engine from scratch using first principles. I plan to make iterations on the project, implementing more and more features as we go.<br>
This is something of a pet project, so progress will probably be slow.

# Tech Stack
For starters, this project will be written in python with graphics done using the library pyopengl. This makes it easy to modify the code and add to it as needed.

# Part 1:
Create a bare-bones rendering model with only triangular surfaces (tuples of 3 points), rendered by simple ray projection.<br>
<b>Iteration 1<b>: This first iteration will not track any information about the objects being rendered, including, crucially, depth. It also maps each pixel of the image frame to a ray, which means we need to be able to adjust the rendered image at the pixel level. This can't be done with opengl, so we will use opencv instead.<br>

Improvements to make: <br>
- map triangles onto the image frame instead of vice versa
- use drawcalls for lines and polygons instead of pixel changes (one layer of abstraction up), use opengl drawing instead of opencv pixel functions
- add a z-buffer to allow for overlapping objects
- systematize vectors in 2d and 3d space by defining vector objects and matrix transforms, associated addition/subtraction, dot/cross product, projections, coordinate systems
- better methods to keep track of pixel coordinates, built in functions for this purpose
- use projection matrices, because calculating all the vectors individually with dot and cross products is exhausting
