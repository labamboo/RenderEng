# RenderEng
Building a rendering engine from scratch using first principles

# Tech Stack
For starters, this project will be written in python with graphics done using the library pyopengl. This makes it easy to modify the code and add to it as needed.

# Part 1:
Create a bare-bones rendering model with only triangular surfaces (tuples of 3 points), rendered by simple ray projection.
